      # ðŸ’¥ CRITICAL FIX: Use the 'cd' command with the 'libexec' directory.
      # Homebrew extracts the tarball into a nested folder. We use Dir.glob to find
      # the correct source directory, which is essential for `swift build` to find Package.swift.
      # The '--strip-components 1' trick is often required for Git-generated tarballs,
      # but in the formula, we use 'cd' to step into the directory.

      # We assume the extracted folder is the only directory in the staging area:
      source_dir = Dir.glob("apple-reminders-cli-*").first

      if source_dir.nil?
        # Fallback in case Homebrew stripped the directory name
        # If the contents are already at the root, no 'cd' is needed.
        # But since we have a nested structure, this suggests the source is buried.
